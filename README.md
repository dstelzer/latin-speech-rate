Usage notes:
 - This relies on a specially-modified version of CLTK, provided at [dstelzer/cltk](https://github.com/dstelzer/cltk).
 - It also relies on Johan Winge's Latin macronizer, [Alatius/latin-macronizer](https://github.com/Alatius/latin-macronizer). This should be installed at `data/latin/latin-macronizer`.
 - Apart from that, all required libraries should be available on PyPI. This code has been tested on Python 3.8.10 but should be compatible with later versions as well.
